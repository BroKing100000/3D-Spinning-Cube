# 3D Spinning Cube

## Why Does This Exist

A stupid project that has no purpose.

Really, I just wanted to impress my <u>computer science teacher</u> by creating a 3D cube in 2D space using the [Python - Turtle Graphics Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). Even though the class ended before I could complete it, I finished it at home and published it.

~~What am I doing with my life?~~

Oh and also, one more reason – I wanted to learn the **Markdown** language. Basically, this file you're reading now.

## How I Made This

I'm too dumb to understand how 3D space even works, so I just copied the [Scratch Tutorial](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/441460754).

Yes, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).

I converted the tutorial, which was intended for Scratch projects, into Python. This really explains why the code in this repository is terrible, because I literally did it in Scratch.

That tutorial explains how to create a simple 3D cube.

## Customization

Well, you can do whatever you want with it, I don't care.

Okay seriously, here are a few variables you can change to your liking without editing much of the code:

```py
angle
cubeColor
backgroundColor
```
Also for easter egg, change the `shape` variable to `BroKing`:
```py
shape = "BroKing"
```
